# Sentiment_Analysis_with_Neural_Networks
Project 6 of AI for Trading ND. 
In this project, you'll build your own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. Your model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, you'll be able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
